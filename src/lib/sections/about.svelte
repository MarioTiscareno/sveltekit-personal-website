				I've mostly worked on backend stuff in C# and the .NET space, but I have some experience

				In my almost 2 decades of programming, I have seen many trends and fads in my trade. I used
				to be a fanatic of Uncle Bob's Clean Coding, Clean Architecture and SOLID. Although I think
				some of these ideas still have value, now I have more appreciation for simplicity and am
				averse to unjustified complexity, premature optimization and over-engineering in general.
