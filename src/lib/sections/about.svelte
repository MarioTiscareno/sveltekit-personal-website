				I've mostly worked on backend stuff in C# and the .NET space, but I have some experience with Python, TypeScript/JavaScript and frontend frameworks like Svelte and React. I also enjoy using Go in my personal

				In my almost two decades of programming, I have seen many trends and fads in my trade. I am averse to unjustified complexity and premature optimization. I think there is value in principles such
				as SOLID, TDD, Functional Programming, and DDD, but I see them only as tools. I believe in using the best tool for the job and I try to identify the key tradeoffs in any project.
